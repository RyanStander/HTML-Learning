    <br><h1>The Gentlemen review – Guy Ritchie’s dated gangster romp</h1>
    <br><h2>Matthew McConaughey, Michelle Dockery and Hugh Grant are amusingly cast, but that doesn’t excuse the casual racism</h2><br>

    <br><br><p>Guy Ritchie’s latest gangster comedy presents itself as a harmless romp, but behind its wink-wink-nudge-nudge humour is a bitter and dated worldview. “There’s fuckery afoot,” clips “cockney Cleopatra” Rosalind (Michelle Dockery). Her analysis is astute.
    </p>
    <p>Self-made Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) is an American interloper and marijuana dealer who wants out of the game. Now middle-aged and comfortably middle class, he hopes to liquidate his weed-farm empire; interested buyers include Jewish-American billionaire Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong, AKA Succession’s Kendall Roy) and Chinese mobster “Dry Eye” (Crazy Rich Asians’ Henry Golding).
    </p>
    <p>We learn of Mickey’s plans and their inevitable unravelling through a screenplay written by sleazy private investigator and aspiring screenwriter Fletcher (Hugh Grant). This is relayed in laborious fashion to Mickey’s right-hand man Ray (Charlie Hunnam, endlessly watchable in owlish glasses). The screenplay is, of course, blackmail, with which Fletcher hopes to exploit Mickey. This convoluted film-within-a-film device also allows Ritchie to quip about pretentiousness and political correctness, snarking about 35mm, Harvey Weinstein’s now shuttered Miramax productions, and Francis Ford Coppola’s The Conversation (“it’s a bit boring”).</p><br><br><br>

    <br><h1>The Platform review – fiendish Netflix thriller about a gory battle for food</h1>
    <br><h2>In this gruesomely effective Spanish fable, people are placed on rotating levels with different amounts to eat, leading to madness and horror</h2><br>

    <br><p>There’s an ingenious idea at the dark heart of the Netflix-acquired Spanish thriller The Platform, slithering online just in time to make certain viewers feel extra guilty for ram-raiding their local supermarkets this past week. It’s a devilish recipe, cooked up from portions of Cube, Saw and Snowpiercer yet with a pungency all of its own, offering those locked away at home a bleak, timely reminder of the need for solidarity and the importance of the collective over the individual – or the grim consequences that might follow.<br><br>
    Reminiscent of the Allegory of the Long Spoons parable, The Platform imagines a brutalist building with an unknown number of levels. Each one contains two people, some of whom are prisoners while others are volunteers entering in exchange for some form of payment. At the very top, on level zero, a grand buffet is sent down through the middle of the room. Each pairing must then eat what they can or what they think they should before it moves down to the next. There’s enough food for all levels but for it to be rationed out equally, it relies on participants to only take what they need. Each month, the pairings are moved to a different level. If you wake up on six then you’re in for a feast but if you happen to wake up on 123 then things are about to get nasty.</p><br><br><br>
