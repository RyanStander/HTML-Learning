				<h1><a href="#">CSS Fix for iOS vh-unit Bug</a></h1>
				<p class="meta"><span class="date">Jul 29, 2015</span> • <a href="#" class="category">Tutorials</a> → <a href="#" class="tag">CSS</a>, <a href="#" class="tag">Responsive Design</a></p>
				<p>There are many Javascript fixes for the viewport height units bug in iOS 7 (iPhone & iPad), this article will cover how to resolve this bug with CSS. This particular bug affects the rendering of viewport height units, for example: if you try to make a full viewport height container with height:100vh, it will display a very tall empty gap. Although this bug was fixed in iOS 8, but many old iPhone and iPad users are still using the old iOS 7. The <a href="#">vh-unit buggyfill</a> is one of the popular Javascript workarounds, but if you don't want to rely on Javascript here is a quick CSS fix using media queries.</p>
